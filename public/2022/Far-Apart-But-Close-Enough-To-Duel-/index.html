        <h1 id="Far-Apart-But-Close-Enough-To-Duel"><a href="#Far-Apart-But-Close-Enough-To-Duel" class="headerlink" title="Far Apart But Close Enough To Duel"></a>Far Apart But Close Enough To Duel</h1><p>Texas and Oklahoma have always been close, but they are far enough apart to make for a good rivalry. The two states are about 880 miles apart, with each claiming around 39 million residents.</p>
<p>The rivalry between the two states can be traced back to 1845 when Texas joined the United States as the 28th state. Oklahoma was still considered part of Indian Territory at that time and did not become its own state until 1907.</p>
<p>Since becoming separate states, the rivalry between Texas and Oklahoma has been based largely on football. The annual game between the two schools is known as the Red River Showdown, with each side taking turns hosting the game in their home stadium. The game is one of the longest-running rivalries in college football, having first been played in 1900.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable moments in this rivalry came in October of 2003, when Texas quarterback Vince Young led his team to a last-second victory over Oklahoma. With just seconds remaining on the clock and trailing by 4 points, Young scrambled for an 8-yard touchdown run to give Texas the win. This play is now known as “The Rose Bowl” and was later named the ESPN Play of the Century.</p>
<p>While there have been many memorable moments in this rivalry, it has also produced its fair share of heartbreak. In 2005, Oklahoma came from behind to beat Texas in what is considered one of the biggest upsets in college football history.</p>
<p>Despite their long history together, Texas and Oklahoma have only met twice in the National Championship game. The first meeting came in 1969, when Texas won a classic showdown 24-17. The second meeting came more than 40 years later in 2005, with Oklahoma winning 14-13.</p>
<p>Even though they are far apart, Texas and Oklahoma have developed one of college football’s best rivalries. With so much history between them, it’s no surprise that these two states continue to trade blows on the gridiron year after year.</p>
<h1 id="Casinos-Battle-It-Out-In-Vicksburg"><a href="#Casinos-Battle-It-Out-In-Vicksburg" class="headerlink" title="Casinos Battle It Out In Vicksburg"></a>Casinos Battle It Out In Vicksburg</h1><p>For a while now, there’s been talk of the new casino that’s being built in Vicksburg. It’s been a long time coming, but it looks like the opening is finally just around the corner.</p>
<p>There are two casinos currently in operation in Vicksburg – Lady Luck and Isle of Capri. Both of these casinos are fighting hard to maintain their market share, and they know that the new casino is going to be a major threat.</p>
<p>The new casino is going to be called The Platinum and it’s going to be huge. It’s going to have over 1,000 slot machines and 50 table games. It’s also going to have a hotel with over 200 rooms, as well as several restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>This is definitely bad news for Lady Luck and Isle of Capri, who are both smaller casinos with fewer amenities. They both offer gaming options, but they can’t compete with the sheer size and scale of The Platinum.</p>
<p>Both Lady Luck and Isle of Capri have already responded by making some changes of their own. Lady Luck has announced that it will be adding a new high limit room, while Isle of Capri has said that it will be expanding its gaming floor.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how these changes will impact things, but one thing is for sure – the battle between the casinos is heating up!</p>
<h1 id="Who-Will-Come-Out-On-Top"><a href="#Who-Will-Come-Out-On-Top" class="headerlink" title="Who Will Come Out On Top?"></a>Who Will Come Out On Top?</h1><p>The next few years in the cryptocurrency market are bound to be exciting, with many surprises in store. Already we’ve seen new players in the market, such as Ripple and Ethereum, as well as a renewed interest in Bitcoin. So who will come out on top?</p>
<p>Bitcoin has been around since 2009 and is still the most popular cryptocurrency. However, its popularity has caused problems with scalability, resulting in high transaction fees and long wait times. This has made other cryptocurrencies more tempting for investors.</p>
<p>Ripple is a payment system that allows for fast and cheap international transactions. It was designed to be used by banks but is also being used by individuals. Ethereum is a platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications. These are just two of the many new cryptocurrencies that are gaining popularity.</p>
<p>Bitcoin still has an advantage over other cryptocurrencies because it is more widely accepted and has a larger user base. However, Ripple and Ethereum are catching up quickly. It will be interesting to see which of these currencies comes out on top in the next few years.</p>
<h1 id="Ameristar-amp-Riverwalk-Casino-Clash-In-Mississippi-Town"><a href="#Ameristar-amp-Riverwalk-Casino-Clash-In-Mississippi-Town" class="headerlink" title="Ameristar &amp; Riverwalk Casino Clash In Mississippi Town"></a>Ameristar &amp; Riverwalk Casino Clash In Mississippi Town</h1><p>The Ameristar Casino and Resort in Vicksburg, Mississippi is suing the Riverwalk Casino and Resort in the town for unfair competition.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the Riverwalk Casino has been using “illegal and deceptive practices” in order to lure customers away from the Ameristar. These practices include offering lower prices on food and drinks, as well as free hotel stays and other gifts.</p>
<p>The Ameristar is seeking an injunction to stop the Riverwalk Casino from using these practices, as well as monetary damages. It is claiming that the Riverwalk Casino has caused it to lose millions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>The Riverwalk Casino has responded by denying all of the claims made by the Ameristar. It argues that its practices are legal and that the Ameristar is simply trying to stifle competition.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-War-Brewing-In-Vicksburg"><a href="#Casino-War-Brewing-In-Vicksburg" class="headerlink" title="Casino War Brewing In Vicksburg"></a>Casino War Brewing In Vicksburg</h1><p>The tiny town of Vicksburg, Mississippi is in the midst of a heated casino war. On one side is the Riverwalk Casino which has been in operation for six years. On the other side is the new casino, the Gold Strike, which opened its doors in February.</p>
<p>The Riverwalk Casino is operated by Penn National Gaming, while the Gold Strike is operated by MGM Resorts International. Both casinos are fighting for market share in this small town.</p>
<p>The Riverwalk Casino is offering a free buffet to anyone who redeems a $10 slot card. They are also offering a free hotel room for anyone who spends $100 on slot machines. The Gold Strike is offering a free buffet to anyone who redeems a $25 slot card.</p>
<p>Both casinos are also offering sign-up bonuses. The Riverwalk Casino is offering a $20 bonus for new players and the Gold Strike is offering a $50 bonus for new players.</p>
<p>So far, the Gold Strike has been winning the battle for market share. In March, they had a 44% market share, while the Riverwalk Casino had a 36% market share.</p>
