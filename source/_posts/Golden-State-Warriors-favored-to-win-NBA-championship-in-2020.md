#  Golden State Warriors favored to win NBA championship in 2020

The Golden State Warriors are favored to win the 2020 NBA championship, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers.

The Warriors are coming off of back-to-back championships and are considered the favorites to win it all once again next season.

Golden State’s top competition is expected to come from the Los Angeles Lakers, who have reloaded this offseason with All-Star additions such as LeBron James and Anthony Davis.

Other contenders include the Boston Celtics, Philadelphia 76ers, Houston Rockets and Milwaukee Bucks.

#  LA Dodgers remain favorites to win the World Series

The Los Angeles Dodgers are still the favorites to win the World Series this year, according to oddsmakers.

Despite losing Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night, the Dodgers are still favored to win the series, according to oddsmakers. The Dodgers opened as 7-5 favorites to win the series and are currently listed at 2-1.

The Houston Astros, who won Game 1 by a score of 7-6, are listed as 5-2 second favorites. The Boston Red Sox, who are in the ALCS against the Houston Astros, are listed as 10-1 third favorites.

The Dodgers will have a chance to even up the series when they take on the Astros in Game 2 on Wednesday night.

#  Los Angeles Rams are Super Bowl LIII betting favorites

The Los Angeles Rams were 7-2 against the spread in 2018 and they will enter the 2019 season as one of the Super Bowl LIII betting favorites.

The Rams finished the 2018 season with a 13-3 record and they defeated the New Orleans Saints 26-23 in overtime in the NFC Championship Game.

Los Angeles is led by quarterback Jared Goff, who passed for 4,688 yards and 32 touchdowns last season. The Rams also have a talented group of receivers, including Brandin Cooks, Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp.

The Rams have one of the best defenses in the NFL, led by defensive tackle Aaron Donald. Los Angeles ranked first in the NFL in both points allowed (14.6 per game) and yards allowed (262.9 per game) last season.

The Atlanta Falcons are also considered contenders to win Super Bowl LIII. The Falcons advanced to the NFC Championship Game last season before losing to the Rams. Atlanta is led by quarterback Matt Ryan, who has passed for 4,000 yards in seven of his nine seasons in the NFL. Receiver Julio Jones is one of the best players in the NFL and he will be joined by first-round draft pick Calvin Ridley this season.

The Minnesota Vikings are another team that could make a run at Super Bowl LIII. The Vikings finished last season with a 13-3 record and they defeated the New Orleans Saints 29-24 in overtime in the NFC Divisional Round of the playoffs. Minnesota is led by quarterback Kirk Cousins, who signed a three-year, $84 million contract with the Vikings this offseason. Receiver Stefon Diggs is one of Cousins’ favorite targets and he will be joined by running back Dalvin Cook this season.

The Los Angeles Rams are expected to be one of the Super Bowl LIII betting favorites when betting opens on Sunday morning at sportsbooks across Las Vegas.

#  Clemson Tigers odds-on favorite to win National Championship

The Clemson Tigers have been tabbed as the odds-on favorite to win the National Championship this season.

After coming within a whisker of winning it all last year, Dabo Swinney’s squad is loaded with talent once again and is expected to make a run at the title.

Led by quarterback Kelly Bryant, the Tigers are betting favorites to take down Alabama in the championship game.

Clemson opened up as 5-point favorites against the Crimson Tide and their odds have since shifted to 4-1.

Alabama is still considered the favorite to win it all, but Clemson is right up there with them as one of the top contenders.

With Bryant under center and a talented group of playmakers surrounding him, the Tigers have what it takes to make a run at the title.

#  Golden State Warriors still early favorites for the NBA Finals

The Golden State Warriors are still the favorites to win the NBA Finals, according to the odds makers. The Warriors opened as a +135 favorite to win the title in June, and they remain at that number today.

Houston is second on the list at +275, followed by Cleveland (+375), Toronto (+550) and Boston (+650). Philadelphia is next at +725, with Oklahoma City at +900.

No other team has shorter odds than +2500 to win the title.

The Warriors are coming off their second championship in three years, and they appear to be headed for another good season. Golden State is one of just three teams in the NBA that Las Vegas oddsmakers give a better than 50-50 chance of making it to the Finals.

The Rockets have been one of the biggest surprises in the league this season. They were expected to be one of the top teams in the Western Conference, but no one expected them to be this good.

Houston has the best record in the league and appears to be a serious threat to Golden State’s crown. The Rockets have plenty of offensive firepower, led by James Harden and Chris Paul. They also have one of the best defenses in the league.

The Cavaliers are still led by LeBron James, but they are not playing as well as they did a year ago. Cleveland has had some struggles this season and could be ripe for an upset in the playoffs.

The Raptors surprised many people last season by reaching the Eastern Conference Finals. This year they appear to be even better, with DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry leading a potent offense. Toronto also has a solid defense that could give teams trouble in the playoffs.

The Celtics are led by Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, two All-Stars who missed most of last season with injuries. Boston is currently second in the Eastern Conference and appears poised for another deep playoff run.
