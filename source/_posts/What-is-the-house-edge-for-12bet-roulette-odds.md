In fact, the main thing you need to remember is that the odds for red and black are always the same, as are the odds for even and odd. This means that you can split your bet between any of these options if you want to, which can give you a little more flexibility when it comes to your betting strategy.

In addition, there are a few other things worth knowing about 12bet roulette odds. For example, the number trio pays out at 6 to 1, while the corner bet pays out at 8 to 1.
