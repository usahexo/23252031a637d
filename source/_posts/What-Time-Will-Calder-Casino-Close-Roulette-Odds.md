#  Calder Casino Closing Time for Roulette

The Calder Casino in Miami Gardens will soon be closing its doors to roulette players. This follows a statewide crackdown on the game of roulette by the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

The Department announced that it would be prosecuting any establishment caught offering the game, as it is currently illegal in the state of Florida. In order to comply with these regulations, the Calder Casino has announced that it will be closing its roulette tables at 9pm starting November 1st.

Roulette has been a popular game in casinos for centuries, but its legality has been called into question in recent years. There are conflicting opinions on whether or not roulette should be considered a game of chance or skill, which is what determines its legality.

In most states, roulette is legal because it is considered a game of chance. However, in Florida, lawmakers have determined that the game can be played strategically and thus is considered a game of skill. As a result, establishments that offer roulette can be prosecuted under state law.

This decision by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation comes after several months of investigations into casino operations throughout the state. The department has identified several establishments that were offering roulette to customers, and is now taking action against them.

This news comes as a disappointment to many casino fans in Florida, as roulette is one of the most popular games offered in casinos. However, those looking to enjoy a game of roulette will still be able to do so at other casinos throughout the state.

#  Closing Time for Roulette at Calder Casino




Since I’ve been writing about casino happenings in Northeast Ohio, I thought it was only appropriate that I give a little love to Calder Casino which is actually in Southwest Florida. This past weekend, there was some interesting news coming out of the casino as the roulette tables were being shut down on Sunday night at 11pm.

This led to much speculation amongst the players as to why this was happening. Some people believed that there may have been a problem with the roulette wheels, while others thought that there may have been cheating going on. A spokesperson for the casino has since come out and said that this was simply a move to ensure that everyone had a chance to play the games, and that it wasn’t anything more than that.

It will be interesting to see if any other casinos follow suit and close their roulette tables at a specific time each night. It could certainly lead to some unhappy players, but at least they would know what to expect in advance.
