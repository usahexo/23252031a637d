#  Casino Luton Sets Minimum Bets for Roulette Games

Casino Luton has announced that it will set minimum bets for roulette games at its venue from November 1. The minimum bet for the table game will be £2 and will apply to all players, including those using the casino’s new electronic roulette terminals.

Talking about the decision, Casino Luton’s Director of Gaming, Ramon Cala, said: “We are committed to providing our customers with a fair and enjoyable gaming experience and feel that this minimum bet limit will help to achieve this. We would like to remind our players that they can enjoy a wide variety of other gaming options on offer at the casino should they wish to play at a lower stake level.”

The move by Casino Luton comes as a number of other UK casinos look to increase their minimum bets for roulette games. In October, Grosvenor Casinos raised its minimum stakes for roulette from £1 to £5 across all its venues. The increase in minimum bets is being seen as a way for casinos to offset falling revenue from other games such as blackjack and slots.

When asked about the reason for raising its minimum stakes, a Grosvenor Casinos spokesperson said: “We continuously review our games offering and felt that it was important to raise the minimum stakes for roulette given its popularity with our customers. This will ensure that players have an enjoyable gaming experience while playing one of our most popular games.”

With a higher minimum bet requirement, players will have more options when it comes to playing different stakes games, and will also have a better chance of winning larger payouts."

In addition to the increase in the minimum bet requirement, Casino Luton will also be introducing a new 'premium' roulette game which will have a minimum bet requirement of £10. This game will offer players a number of exclusive features, including higher payouts and an expanded betting range.

The spokesperson continued, "We're excited to be introducing our new premium roulette game. This game offers our players the chance to win big payouts, and with a minimum bet requirement of just £10, it's accessible to everyone."

Casino Luton has today announced that it will be implementing new minimum bet requirements for all roulette games played at the casino. The new minimum bet requirement will be £5 per game, starting from Wednesday 3rd October 2018.

The decision to increase the minimum bet requirement was made in order to provide a more enjoyable experience for players, and to deter any form of cheating or fraudulent behaviour. Casino Luton also hopes that the increased minimum bet requirement will lead to an increase in overall revenue.

We hope that players will appreciate the added security measures we’re taking, and that it will lead to an increase in revenue.”

Roulette is one of the most popular casino games around, and the new minimum bet requirement is likely to affect a large number of players. However, Casino Luton has said that it will be giving players plenty of notice ahead of the changes taking effect, in order to allow them time to adjust their betting strategies accordingly.
