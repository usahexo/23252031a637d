#  NJ Officially Legalizes Online Poker

The state of New Jersey has become the third in the nation to officially legalize online poker. The law, which was passed in February and took effect on July 1, allows online poker players within the state to gamble at approved sites.

“This is a great day for New Jersey and its residents,” said Governor Phil Murphy in a statement. “We are proud to be leaders in legalizing and regulating this new form of entertainment that will create jobs and generate economic activity throughout our state.”

To ensure that players are protected, the law mandates that all online poker sites be licensed and regulated by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. Players must also be 21 years or older and located within the state in order to participate.

The legalization of online poker is expected to provide a major boost to the state’s economy. A study conducted by Cambridge Economic Research Associates (CERA) found that legalized online poker would generate between $60 million and $180 million in annual economic activity within New Jersey. This includes jobs and other revenue generated from the industry, such as taxes.

Poker players are already beginning to take advantage of the new law. On July 1, the first day it was legal, more than $1 million was wagered on New Jersey’s regulated poker sites. This is a strong indication that there is considerable interest in playing online poker within the state.

Other states are expected to follow suit in legalizing online poker in the near future. This is because states are increasingly looking for ways to generate revenue, and online poker is an attractive option given its potential to generate millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.

#  NJ Becomes the Third State to Legalize Online Poker

After a few years of debate and discussion, New Jersey has finally become the third state to legalize online poker. The new law will come into effect on January 31, and it will allow players in the state to access regulated online poker rooms.

The passage of the bill was not without controversy, however. Several lawmakers voted against it, arguing that it would create an opportunity for criminal activity. But proponents of the measure countered that regulating the industry would actually make it safer for players.

Now that online poker is legal in New Jersey, there are already a number of operators who have obtained licenses to offer services in the state. These include Caesars Interactive Entertainment, PokerStars, and Golden Nugget Atlantic City. expect more to follow suit in the coming months.

Players who reside in New Jersey will be able to access these sites from their computers or mobile devices, and they can also participate in games that are hosted by operators in other states that have legalized online poker. This will give them access to a much larger pool of players, which should result in better games and greater excitement.

Since online poker is now legal in New Jersey, we can expect to see increased traffic at the casinos located in Atlantic City. These venues have been struggling in recent years due to competition from other gambling destinations, but online poker could provide them with a much-needed boost.

Atlantic City is not the only beneficiary of this development, however. The new law is also good news for the state's economy as a whole. It is estimated that online poker will generate between $10 and $16 million annually in tax revenue for New Jersey.

#  NJ Moves Forward with Legislation for Online Gaming

In October of 2017, the New Jersey Senate passed a bill legalizing online gaming in the state. The bill allows for casino gambling, poker, and other gambling games to be played online. The New Jersey Assembly is expected to pass the bill as well, and Governor Chris Christie has already said he will sign it into law.

Supporters of the bill say that it will bring in much-needed revenue to the state. In addition, they argue that it will help preserve jobs at Atlantic City casinos, which have been struggling in recent years.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to an increase in problem gambling behaviors. They also say that it will make it more difficult for casinos in Atlantic City to compete with those in other states.

The move by New Jersey comes as other states are also considering legalizing online gaming. In September, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed a bill legalizing online gaming, and the Michigan Senate is considering a similar measure.

#  NJ Prepares to License and Regulate Online Gaming

In February, Chris Christie signed a bill into law authorizing the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement to license and regulate online gaming. Operators must pay a $400,000 licensing fee and be located in Atlantic City.

The new law authorizes the following games:

-Slot machines
-Table games such as blackjack, roulette, and craps
-Poker
-Bingo
-Lottery tickets

Residents of New Jersey will be able to play at licensed online gaming sites starting on November 26th. The state is expecting to generate $1 billion in revenue from online gaming over the next five years. Revenue will be used to fund programs for senior citizens and disabled veterans.

Online gaming opponents argue that the new law will increase addiction and crime rates. Supporters point to the fact that the law includes strong consumer protections, including age verification and self-exclusion programs.

#  NJ Advances Plans for a Safe and Secure Online Gaming Industry

In the wake of New Jersey’s successful push to legalize online gambling, the industry has been working hard to put in place the necessary security measures to protect players.

One of the main concerns for regulators has been safeguarding players against fraud and money laundering. To that end, online gaming operators have been required to implement a number of strict controls, including identity verification procedures and systems to track player activity.

While there have been some initial hiccups in getting the industry up and running, regulators believe that the measures in place are sufficient to protect players. And with more than $1 billion already wagered since the launch of New Jersey’s online casinos in November 2013, it would appear that players feel confident enough in the security of the industry to risk their money.

The success of New Jersey’s online gambling industry could pave the way for other states to follow suit. This would create a nationwide market for online gaming, which would be a boon for operators and players alike. The potential for growth is huge, as is the potential for further security enhancements as operators gain experience in running a safe and secure online gaming operation.
