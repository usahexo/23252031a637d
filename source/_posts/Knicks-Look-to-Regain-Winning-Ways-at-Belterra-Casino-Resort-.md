#  Knicks Look to Regain Winning Ways at Belterra Casino Resort 

The New York Knicks (4-10) hope to get back on track when they take on the Indiana Pacers (8-7), Wednesday night at the Belterra Casino Resort in Florence, Indiana.

The game will be their second contest of a three-game road trip. The Knicks are coming off a 117-101 loss to the Washington Wizards on Monday. The Pacers are also coming off a loss, falling to the Detroit Pistons, 97-91, on Tuesday night.

The Pacers have had the edge over the Knicks in past meetings. In the last 10 games between the two teams, Indiana has won eight times. The Pacers have also taken six of the last seven meetings at home.

New York is led by Kristaps Porzingis, who is averaging 25.9 points and 7.4 rebounds per game. Enes Kanter is averaging 14 points and 10 rebounds per game off of the bench for the Knicks. Tim Hardaway Jr., who missed Monday's game against Washington with a left ankle injury, is questionable for Wednesday's contest against Indiana.

Indiana is paced offensively by Victor Oladipo, who is averaging 24 points and 5.2 assists per game this season. Myles Turner averages 13.5 points and 6.9 rebounds per game, while Domantas Sabonis contributes 11 points and 7 rebounds per outing off of the bench for Indiana.

Wednesday's contest could come down to which team can better execute offensively in the paint. The Pacers have been dominant in that area this season, outscoring their opponents in the paint by an average of 10 points per game - seventh best in the NBA. The Knicks have been outscored by their opponents in that area this season by an average of 4 points per game - 26th worst in the league.

#  Brooklyn Nets Pay a Visit to the Belterra Casino Resort to Take on the Knicks 

The Brooklyn Nets were in Indiana on Wednesday to take on the Pacers, but they made a pit stop before that game at the Belterra Casino Resort.

Belterra is a casino and resort located about an hour southeast of Indianapolis. It was host to the Nets on Wednesday as they took on the Knicks in an NBA preseason game.

The Nets were able to come away with a 111-104 victory over their New York counterparts. Jeremy Lin led the way for Brooklyn with 20 points, while D’Angelo Russell added 19.

For the Knicks, Tim Hardaway Jr. led all scorers with 23 points. Enes Kanter added 18 points and 15 rebounds in the loss.

The game wasn’t without its controversies, though. Late in the fourth quarter, Knicks guard Emmanuel Mudiay was ejected for making contact with Nets forward Rondae Hollis-Jefferson while he was in the air.

Mudiay appeared to reach up and hit Hollis-Jefferson in the head while he was trying to make a layup, and officials determined that it was a Flagrant 2 foul, resulting in his ejection.

Both teams will now turn their attention to their respective regular seasons, which will tip off next week. The Nets open up their season at home against the Atlanta Hawks on October 17th, while the Knicks will travel to Houston to take on the Rockets on October 17th as well.
