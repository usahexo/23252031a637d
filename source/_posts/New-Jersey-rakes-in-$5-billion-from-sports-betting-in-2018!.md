#  New Jersey rakes in $5 billion from sports betting in 2018!

In case you haven't heard, New Jersey is absolutely raking in the profits from sports betting! According to recently released figures, the Garden State pulled in an astonishing $5 billion in revenue last year. And this number is only going to continue to grow in 2019 and beyond.

What's behind this booming industry? Well, a large part of it can be attributed to the fact that New Jersey has been one of the most progressive states when it comes to legalizing sports betting. Other states are now starting to follow suit, but New Jersey has a significant head start.

This massive influx of cash is already having a positive impact on the state economy. It's creating new jobs and generating tax revenue that can be used for things like infrastructure improvements and education funding. Not to mention, it's putting more money back into the hands of consumers, which is always a good thing.

So what do New Jersey lawmakers plan to do with all this extra cash? There are discussions underway about using some of it to finance a new stadium for the state's beloved football team, the Giants. This would certainly be a welcome development, as the team's current stadium is in desperate need of an upgrade.

All in all, it looks like things are shaping up quite nicely for New Jersey's sports betting industry. With more states likely to legalize gambling in the coming years, the sky is the limit!

#  New Jersey becomes sports betting powerhouse, sees over $3 billion in total wagers!

In the wake of the United States Supreme Court’s landmark decision to repeal the federal prohibition on sports gambling, New Jersey has become a major sports betting powerhouse.

According to figures released by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the state has seen over $3 billion in total wagers since legalization in June 2018.

This number is all the more impressive when you consider that New Jersey only comprises less than 1% of the US population.

Most of this activity has been centered around Atlantic City, with over $2.5 billion wagered at casinos and racetracks in the city since legalization.

This newfound popularity has unquestionably been a boon for Atlantic City’s casinos, which have seen their revenues surge since sports betting became legal.

In addition to Atlantic City, there has also been significant betting activity in other parts of New Jersey. Monmouth Park racetrack, located in Oceanport, has seen over $600 million in total wagers, while Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City has taken in over $300 million.

While it is still too early to tell if this increased gambling activity will be beneficial to New Jersey’s overall economy, there is little doubt that it has been a major boon for its casinos and racetracks.

#  New Jersey sees record $574 million in sports betting revenue in Q1 2019!

New Jersey officials are celebrating record sports betting revenues in the first quarter of 2019. Figures released by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement show that $574 million was wagered on sports in the three months from January to March. Of that, operators kept $39 million in profits – a significant increase on the $24 million generated in the final quarter of 2018.

The news is a vindication of New Jersey’s decision to legalize sports betting following the repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) in 2018. PASPA had effectively banned sports betting across most of the United States, with only Nevada being exempt. New Jersey was one of a number of states that challenged PASPA in court, arguing that it unfairly restricted their right to regulate gambling within their borders.

The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of New Jersey in May 2018. This led to a flurry of activity as states rushed to legalize sports betting, with Delaware among the first to do so later that month.

Since then, New Jersey has emerged as one of the biggest markets for sports betting in the US. The $574 million wagered in Q1 2019 represents a ten-fold increase on what was bet in New Jersey during Q4 2017, before PASPA was repealed. It also puts New Jersey well ahead of its nearest rival, Pennsylvania, which generated $385 million in revenue from sports betting in Q1 2019.

In addition to its success at attracting gamblers, New Jersey has also been successful in attracting online gaming companies. In February 2019, gaming giant MGM Resorts announced that it would be partnering with Atlantic City casino Borgata to offer online poker and casino games throughout New Jersey. The deal is seen as a major boost for Borgata, which has been struggling financially in recent years.

Atlantic City has long been known as one of America’s premier casino destinations, but its fortunes have taken a turn for the worse in recent years. A string of casino closures has left the city with just eight casinos remaining, down from twelve a few years ago. Sports betting is seen as an important part of Atlantic City’s bid to revive its fortunes, and it looks like things are starting to pick up: In Q1 2019, gambling revenue increased by 5% year-on-year, with sports betting accounting for much of this growth.

It remains to be seen how long this growth can be sustained, but for now at least, things are looking up for both Atlantic City and New Jersey!

#  New Jersey's legal sports betting market hits another milestone, surpasses $1 billion in handle!

_New Jersey's legal sports betting market generates more than $1 billion in handle in less than two years, new report shows._

Legal sports betting in New Jersey has generated more than $1 billion in handle in less than two years, according to a report released this week by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement.

The report found that during the month of September, the state’s legal sportsbooks took in nearly $214 million in bets, up from $183 million in August. That brings the total amount wagered on sports in New Jersey since it launched its regulated market in June 2018 to $1.16 billion.

In terms of revenue, New Jersey’s legal sportsbooks generated just under $25 million during September, up from $20 million in August. That brings the total amount won by casinos and racetracks with a NJ sports betting license to just over $290 million.

The fact that New Jersey’s legal sports betting market has now surpassed the $1 billion mark is not surprising, especially given the surge in betting activity we’ve seen recently. But it does underscore how quickly this industry is growing and how important it is to states looking to boost their tax revenue.

#  Sports betting fuels another record month for New Jersey casinos, with $272 million in revenues

Sports betting was a big moneymaker for New Jersey's casinos in November.

According to figures released Wednesday by the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, the casinos took in $272 million in sports bets last month. That was up from October's total of $236 million and just shy of the all-time high of $273 million set in August.

 Revenue from all gambling at the casinos was also up in November, totaling $515 million, compared with $483 million in October.

Just two months after Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill legalizing sports betting at the state's casinos and racetracks, New Jersey has quickly become one of the nation's top markets for sports betting.

The jump in November's numbers was fueled by the start of the NFL season and the expansion of sports betting to include wagers on college games.

"This is further evidence that New Jersey is now leading the nation in legalized sports betting," said David Rebuck, director of the gaming enforcement division. "We are seeing increased visitation to our casinos and race tracks as people take advantage of this new form of entertainment."
